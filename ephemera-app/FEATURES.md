# Ephemera - Feature Documentation

## 🎯 What Makes This Novel?

Ephemera isn't just another "disappearing messages" app. Here's what makes it truly unique:

### 1. **Active Transformation, Not Just Deletion**

Unlike Snapchat or Signal's disappearing messages that simply delete after a timer:
- Content **actively evolves** in real-time
- Multiple decay algorithms create different artistic effects
- Users witness the transformation process
- Each viewing is a unique experience

### 2. **Multiple Decay Modes**

Different content types decay in different ways, mimicking natural processes:

| Decay Mode | Effect | Use Case |
|------------|--------|----------|
| **Fade** | Character-by-character opacity reduction | Text messages, poetry |
| **Pixelate** | Progressive pixelation into digital blocks | Drawings, images |
| **Blur** | Gaussian blur increase | Memories, abstract thoughts |
| **Fragment** | Words drift apart in 2D space | Stream of consciousness |
| **Dissolve** | Combined blur + fade | General content |

### 3. **Philosophical Foundation**

Ephemera is built on principles of digital mindfulness:
- Encourages presence over preservation
- Mirrors the impermanence of real-life experiences
- Reduces digital hoarding anxiety
- Creates space for genuine, temporary connections

## 🔧 Technical Innovation

### Decay Engine (`lib/decay.ts`)

The core of Ephemera is a sophisticated decay engine that calculates:

```typescript
// Time-based decay progress (0 to 1)
getDecayProgress(config: DecayConfig): number

// Character-level opacity for text
getCharacterDecay(text: string, progress: number): number[]

// Pixelation amount for images
getPixelation(progress: number): number

// Blur intensity
getBlur(progress: number): number

// 2D displacement for fragments
getFragmentDisplacement(progress: number, seed: number): {x, y}
```

#### Easing Functions

Custom easing creates natural-feeling decay:
- `easeInOutCubic`: Smooth acceleration/deceleration
- `easeOutQuart`: Natural fade-out feeling
- Linear interpolation for consistent timing

### Performance Optimizations

1. **RAF-Based Updates**: Uses `setInterval` at 50ms for smooth 20 FPS decay
2. **Canvas Optimization**: Pixelation algorithm only samples necessary pixels
3. **Framer Motion**: GPU-accelerated animations for 60 FPS UI
4. **Memoization**: Character arrays cached to prevent recalculation

### Client-Side Only Architecture

Zero backend required:
- No database needed
- No user accounts
- No server-side logic
- Pure React state management
- Completely private by default

## 🎨 Features Deep Dive

### 1. Fading Messages

**How It Works:**
- Each character has independent opacity
- Characters fade at staggered rates based on position
- Progress bar shows remaining time
- Expired messages trigger callback for cleanup

**Algorithm:**
```typescript
// Characters fade with position-based offset
charOpacity[i] = 1 - (progress - (i / length) * 0.3) * 1.5
```

This creates a wave-like fade from start to finish.

**Use Cases:**
- Temporary announcements
- Poetic expressions
- Secrets that shouldn't be stored
- Mindfulness exercises

### 2. Decaying Canvas

**How It Works:**
- User draws on hidden high-res canvas
- Display canvas shows pixelated version
- Pixel size increases over time
- Final result: abstract pixel art

**Algorithm:**
```typescript
// Sample original canvas and render with increasing block size
pixelSize = Math.max(1, getPixelation(progress))
for each block:
  sample single pixel from original
  fill entire block with that color
```

**Why It's Cool:**
- Transforms precise drawings into abstract art
- Each stage of decay is aesthetically interesting
- Makes users appreciate the creation process
- Perfect for collaborative digital art sessions

### 3. Temporary Rooms

**How It Works:**
- Dual timers: room lifetime + individual message lifetime
- Messages auto-remove when expired
- Room self-destructs at end of duration
- No persistence - refresh creates new room

**State Management:**
```typescript
interface Message {
  id: string
  text: string
  timestamp: number
  decayDuration: number
}

// Messages filtered in real-time
messages.filter(msg =>
  now - msg.timestamp < msg.decayDuration
)
```

**Use Cases:**
- Brainstorming sessions
- Temporary support groups
- Time-boxed discussions
- Ephemeral feedback collection

### 4. Memory Fragments

**How It Works:**
- Each word is an independent entity
- Words drift in 2D space based on seeded randomness
- Blur increases as words separate
- Glow effect reduces as opacity fades

**Algorithm:**
```typescript
// Consistent randomness from word + position
seed = seedFromString(word + index)
angle = seed * PI * 2

// Distance increases with decay
distance = easeOutQuart(progress) * 100
x = cos(angle) * distance
y = sin(angle) * distance

// Combined blur + fade
blur = progress * 20px
opacity = 1 - progress * 1.2
```

**Why It's Poetic:**
- Mimics how real memories work
- Central concept remains while details blur
- Visual metaphor for the passage of time
- Creates accidental poetry through spatial arrangement

## 🎭 Design Principles

### Visual Language

- **Dark Theme**: Reduces eye strain, creates intimate atmosphere
- **Purple/Pink Gradient**: Represents the liminal space between existence/non-existence
- **Glow Effects**: Makes content feel ethereal and temporary
- **Smooth Animations**: Creates calm, meditative experience

### User Experience

1. **No Tutorial Needed**: Intuitive interactions
2. **Immediate Engagement**: No signup, no onboarding
3. **Clear Feedback**: Progress bars and timers everywhere
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Content fades beautifully, doesn't just disappear

### Accessibility

- High contrast text (WCAG AAA compliant initially)
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly (ARIA labels on interactive elements)
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (via Framer Motion)

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Potential Features

1. **Audio Ephemera**
   - Sounds that degrade like old cassette tapes
   - Music that slowly loses frequencies
   - Voice messages that become increasingly distorted

2. **Collaborative Decay**
   - Multiple users affect decay rate
   - Shared canvases with synchronized pixelation
   - Collective memory gardens

3. **Seasonal Decay Modes**
   - Morning: slow, peaceful decay
   - Night: faster, more dramatic transformations
   - Weather-reactive: decay matches local conditions

4. **AR Integration**
   - Place ephemeral messages in physical space
   - Drawings that decay in augmented reality
   - Location-based temporary content

5. **Entropy Visualization**
   - Beautiful data viz of decay patterns
   - Export decay animations as art
   - Entropy heat maps

### Technical Roadmap

- [ ] WebGL for more complex visual effects
- [ ] Web Audio API for sound experiments
- [ ] WebRTC for real-time multi-user rooms
- [ ] Service Worker for offline capability (ironic for ephemeral app!)
- [ ] WebAssembly for physics-based decay simulations

## 🌟 Impact & Philosophy

In an age of:
- Permanent social media posts
- Endless scrolling and archiving
- Digital hoarding
- Screenshot culture

- Mindful digital experiences

### Intended Emotions

Users should feel:
- **Present**: Must pay attention now, can't "save for later"
- **Free**: Nothing they create is permanent, reducing pressure
- **Contemplative**: Watching content decay is meditative
- **Connected**: Shared temporary experiences create intimacy
